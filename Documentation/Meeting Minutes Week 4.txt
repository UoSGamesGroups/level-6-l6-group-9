L6 - Group 9 - Minutes - 16/11/2016

Max Bovis, Henry Hardy, Junior Shonowo, Rob Kurta, Steve Harrison

What Went Well:

 - Presentation; Rob and Steve liked it, very few questions
 - Tasks assigned quickly and without problem
 - Work flow consistent

Issues:

 - Uploading work onto Github (Max)
 - Number of hours spent working on project (Low due to Junior recently joining project and
   being sure of project before start)

Feedback:

 - Reduce the amount of game planned; 2 minutes of great game is more desirable than 10 
   minutes of okay game

Plan For The Week:

Max - In-depth level design (asset placement and visuals)
    - Continue creating and/or finding sound effects

Henry - Implement level designs in the prototype
      - Begin working on the puzzle mechanics

Junior - Continue modelling and texturing assets for the game

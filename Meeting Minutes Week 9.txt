L6 - Group 9 - 08/02/17

Max Bovis, Henry Hardy, Junior Shonowo, Dave Pimm, Eddie Duggan

What Went Well:

 - Content of the presentation was okay
 - Presentation style was good, considering things were somewhat rushed for the presentation
 - Dave believes the game is a good idea and has the potential to be fun

Issues:

 - Writing too small in the presentation
 - Not enough art and assets to really give feedback on

Feedback:

 - Open the presentation with the video of the game and then comment over it, rather than giving comments on
   an abstract concept
 - Focus on the detail of every piece of the game visually, immerion is key to the experience, and may
   be broken if any details break the diegesis. 

Plans For The Week:

 Max - Modelling and texturing to get a number of assets together

 Henry - Tweak dust and other visual effects
       - Finish level primitive
       - Create asset list

Junior - Continue modelling, texturing and bone rigging the antagonist

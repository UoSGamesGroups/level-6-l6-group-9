What Went Well:

 - Lecturers feel that the game is progressing nicely
 - Glad that we're aiming for a short experience

Issues:

 - Antagonist needs to be modelled, rigged and animated to get a real feel for the level of 
   detail required in the rest of the textures
 - Game needs to be brought to a point where it can be playtested

Feedback:

 - Game is a neat idea and is achievable
 - Level of texture detail is essential to the rest of the game

Plans For The Week:

 Max - Get at minimum a basic level of interior design for the entire country house

 Henry - Tweak code to run smoother

 Junior - Model, texture and rig the antagonist

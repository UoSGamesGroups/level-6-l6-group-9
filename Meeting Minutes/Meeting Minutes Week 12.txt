Max Bovis, Henry Hardy, Junior Shonowo, Dave Pimm, Eddie Duggan

What Went Well:

 - We have a good logline
 - The game is close to being really good
 - Feedback was very helpful

Issues:

 - Tuesday sprints, need to get work done over the course of the week
 - Uploading on GitHub needs to happen more
 - Game needs polish

Feedback:

 - Don't make voice lines for the antagonist, just breathing makes him scarier
 - Play with shadows to reduce visibility of the antagonist and create more ambiguity
 - Apostraphes can indicate possession
 - Fill out the level more with spaces and objects to facilitate gameplay

Plans For The Week:

 Max - Finish texturing current models
     - Create assorted breathing sounds

 Henry - Finish level primitive
       - Continue with code tweaks to polish mechanics

 Junior - Animating the antagonist
        - Fixing the antagonist's collar

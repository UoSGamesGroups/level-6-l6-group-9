Max Bovis, Henry Hardy, Junior Shonowo, Rob Kurta

What Went Well:

 - Rob believes the game has real potential
 - Rob gave advice on how to playtest the game

Issues:

 - E-mail communication has been sparse and needs to increase
 - Github needs to be more rigorously updated so that progress is visible

Feedback:

 - Feature completion needs to happen as soon as possible
 - Playtesting can provide some real polish to the game, the more the better

Plans For The Week:

 Max - Continue modelling and texturing to get a number of implementable assets together
       so that feature completion can occur

 Henry - Finish level primitive
       - Implement various assets

 Junior - Finish the antagonist model so that it can be exported to Unity
